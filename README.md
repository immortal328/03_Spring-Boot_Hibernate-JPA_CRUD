<h1>Spring-Boot Hibernate / JPA</h1>

Crafted a dynamic Spring Boot Hibernate/JPA project facilitating complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a Student model. 
The project offers two sets of REST endpoints: 
  - the first set, accessible via '/v1/entityManager', employs EntityManager for CRUD functionality, 
  - the second set, available at '/v1/JPA', extends the JPARepository for similar operations.
  - 
MySQL is the chosen database, with connection configurations streamlined through a YAML file for seamless deployment on localhost.
